There are 260 new PowerToys ideas. So I wanted to clean that up. Here's the list:

**Update 2**

# Duplications / Comments
* [ ] #88 needs Author feedback about the license
   * crutkas: pinged, still good idea
* [x] I think #109 is already implemented in KeyboardManager 
   * crutkas: asked + set author feedback label
* [ ] ~~#131 implemented in windows 10 in Mouse Options~~ (Also #981 )
   * crutkas: #131 disagree, see comments below
   * crutkas: where is #981 in the OS?
* [x] #704 Needs Author-Feedback
   * crutkas: asked + set author feedback label
* [ ] ~~#1045 is PowerRename not?~~
   * per @mrlacey's comment in #1045, Grep is different
* [ ] ~~#1226 is duplicate of #77~~
   * OSS MWB (#77) is about different computers w/ single keyboard.  #1226 is to help deal with the hard offsets with different size screens (example laptop + 24" monitor)
* [x] #1240 isn't a new PowerToy. More a new Item for Settings.
   * totally can see this being a PowerToy.
* [x] #46 is already in windows 10
* [x] I think #66 is the same as #43
* [x] #85 is already something suggested in #73 (Duplicate: #4189 , #4663)
   * crutkas: #73vs#85, they are different asks
* [x] #1331 is duplicate of #472
* [x] #2615 is too dangerous
* [x] #2899 and #5721 are the same as #115
* [x] #2954 is duplicate of #278
* [x] #3064 is in #1196
* [x] #3096 is also in #825 (Duplicate: #5083 , #5657)
* [x] #3217 is more a bug then a PowerToy idea
* [x] #3531 duplicate of #26
* [x] #3570 is duplicate of #10
* [x] #3982 is duplicate of #1642
* [x] #4408 also is in #1951
* [x] #5466 is in #3442
* [x] #5499 duplicate of #3583
* [x] #6244 duplicate of #5074
