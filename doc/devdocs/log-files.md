To read PowerToys log files you can use the Analogy Log Viewer with the DLL from @LiorBanai.

> I have created log parser for the logs created by PowerToys.
> It may be relevant/usefull for troubleshooting issues and errors.
> 
> I have multi purpose log application at [Analogy Log Viewer](https://github.com/Analogy-LogViewer/Analogy.LogViewer)
> A also created dedicated Parser at [Analogy.LogViewer.PowerToys](https://github.com/Analogy-LogViewer/Analogy.LogViewer.PowerToys)
> 
> for now, It targeted .net core 3.1 so just need to download [Analogy Log Viewer latest](https://github.com/Analogy-LogViewer/Analogy.LogViewer/releases/tag/V4.2.9), download [PowerToy Parser dll](https://github.com/Analogy-LogViewer/Analogy.LogViewer.PowerToys/releases/tag/V0.1.0), put it at the same folder of the application and run it.
