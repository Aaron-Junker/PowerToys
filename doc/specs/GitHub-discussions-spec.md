## What is GitHub Discussions

GitHub discussion is a feature that currently is in the closed beta status. It will be released until the end of the year. 

It's a new tab in the GitHub overview where People can start new Threads like in a forum.

The threads must be added to a category. The answer feature can be enabled or disabled for categorys. If enabled a triager or the creator of the thread can mark a reply as answer.

You can sort threads in the overview for categories anf for (un-)answerd.
